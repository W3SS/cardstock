Welcome! For the past four years, I've been working
with some amazing students to build a card game simulation engine called
[CardStock](http://github.com/mgoadric/cardstock), along with a new
language for programming card games named [RECYCLE](https://cardstock.readthedocs.io/en/latest/recycle/index.html).
This blog is a culmination and continuation of this research project
investigating the structure, dynamics, and mechanics of card games. 

The first few years were just getting things to work and laying our 
our framework. By now, we've implemented and explored many card games, 
from classics such as [Spades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spades) and 
[Hearts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearts) to modern card games such as [Coloretto](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/5782/coloretto), 
[Lost Cities](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/50/lost-cities), and 
[The Bottle Imp](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/619/bottle-imp). And with over 26 games written in RECYCLE, it is time
to start diving deeper to find connections and see how these computational tools can
help us understand how card games work and maybe how to make better ones.

I'll be writing articles about once a week, addressing a particular game or variant
we've simulated with our system, and plan to continue posting for at least a year.
Through this process, there are a number of research questions I hope to answer:

* What are appropriate heuristics for evaluating card games?
* At a minimum, is each game fair, balanced, and interesting?
* Can we cluster card games by their rules, structure, or behavior?
* What AI techniques are most feasible for general card game playing?
* Can insights from studying natural card game evolution help computers create new games?

Thanks for joining me on this project, let me know if there are other questions 
you think we could answer, or games you want to see covered!
