### Rules

**Agram** is a simple Nigerian trick-taking card game for 2 to 6 players. Players are dealt six cards from a reduced French deck, and play six tricks. To win a trick, players must follow the suit of the lead player with a higher card; there is no trump suit. The object of the game is to win the last trick.

### RECYCLE Coding

To illustrate how the previous elements can be combined to create a complete game, on the following page we include a full encoding of Agram.

In lines 2 through 10, the number of players are defined, the teams are defined as individuals, indicating no alliances, and the deck is instantiated to the `STOCK`location. Because the rules for Agram dictate that there is no Ace of Spades, two separate `create deck` calls were necessary.

In lines 12 through 14, the `STOCK` location, now containing all of the requisite cards, is shuffled, and 6 cards are dealt to each player.

Lines 20 through 25 handle the case in which at least the first card of the trick has been played and the player is unable to follow suit, and are therefore allowed to play any card from their `HAND` to their `TRICK` location.

Lines 26 through 33 handle the case in which at least the first card of the trick has been played and the player can (and therefore must) play a card which follows suit.

Lines 34 through 38 give the first player the freedom to play any card, and subsequently `remember` that card to the `LEAD` location, ensuring that the following players will be forced into one of the two cases above.

The `comp`in lines 39 through 53 determines the winner of each trick using the scoring function defined in lines 41 through 46, clears the `LEAD` memory location, sets the next leader to be the player who holds the winning card, and clears the cards from the last trick. In the event all of the players' `HAND` locations are empty, indicating the game is over, it awards 1 point to the player who won the most recent trick. 

Line 54 declares that the winner of the game is the player with the highest value in their `SCORE` storage bin. From the prior rules we know that only one player will receive a point each game, making this a decidable and unique maximum value and owner.

### Analysis

As described earlier, Agram is a small trick-taking game. With only six tricks to be won, we first asked: *is there a balance between player choice and the potential for strategy?*

![Agram Branching Factor]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/agram/AgramBFRev.png){:class="post-image"}

The above image shows the average player decision branching factor with default random players. There are four graphs, aggregated depending on the player's turn order in relation to the lead player for each trick. We can see the effect of being forced to follow suit when possible. The lead player can always play whatever card they desire, but following players are then limited to approximately 2.5 card choices on average for the first three tricks and tapering off thereafter. There is a definite advantage to being in the lead player in terms of player choice.

![Agram AI]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/agram/AgramIntelligent.png){:class="post-image"}

To investigate the potential for strategy in Agram, we ran simulations for 2 through 5 players, using one PIPMC with the remaining players random. We can see above the win percentage for the PIPMC player in comparison to the expected probability of winning for a random player, given the assumption that the game is balanced. PIPMC players are able to control their fate, outperforming the expected value by approximately 20 percentage points across all player sizes. However, there is still enough randomness in the game to confound their ability to win. 

Given the above, we next investigated: *What is the smallest number of tricks that still allows for a fair game?* We can easily explore variants of Agram by changing one number in the RECYCLE description. Our first set of variants altered the number of cards dealt to each player from one to six, while fixing the number of players at two. The next figure shows the results for each hand size using random players. We can see that with four, five or six cards, the game appears fair, however, a clear bias for the first player emerges as the number of cards is reduced. We believe that because the suit led becomes the highest precedence, it is very unlikely in such limited games that the following player is able to follow suit and thus is doomed to failure.

These results track with the known variants of Agram. In particular, the version in which players are dealt only five cards instead of six is known as Sink-Sink\footnote{Rules for Sink-Sink can be found on the Pagat page for Agram listed above.}. There are no established variants of smaller size, perhaps due to a human player's refusal to repeatedly play a game that is unfair.

Our second set of variants retains the deal of six cards, but changes the number of tricks played before determining the winner. As above, we fix the number of players at two and run simulations with random players. In the above figure, we see that most variants are relatively balanced games, except for when the game is decided after playing only one trick.
