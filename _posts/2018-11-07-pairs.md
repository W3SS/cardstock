Pairs is a press-your-luck card game for 2 to 6 players, described by designers James Ernest and Paul Peterson as ``a new classic pub game.''\footnote{https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/152237/pairs} 

### Rules

**Pairs** uses a custom deck of 55 cards, containing one card of value 1, two cards of value 2, etc., up to ten cards of value 10. Each round players are dealt one card to a face-up hand, and then players cycle in turn order to either end the round by scoring the minimum value card in play or draw another card into their hand. If the drawn card is the same value as a card currently in their hand, the player scores that many points and the round is over.
The first player to score a set number of points over multiple rounds is the loser, so players strive to minimize their points.

### Analysis

First, we examined the question: \textit{how can turn order be manipulated to create a fair game?} We focused on games with four random players. In the four-person version, the game is over when one player earns at least 16 points. Initially, we found that all players have an expected value of slightly over 9 points. This points to a fair game, however, we found evidence of turn order bias within an individual round.

\ColumnFigure{1}{graphics/PairsFairness2.pdf}{Unfairness of turn order in Pairs.}{fig:PairsFairness}

Figure \ref{fig:PairsFairness} shows the expected value for each player in one individual round. In these experiments, players were not given the option of stopping early, to isolate the effect of drawing another card. The rules of Pairs designate the player with the minimum valued card as the first player. This led to an unbalanced game, where the second player has the worst expected value. However, we can see the benefit of this approach in comparison to a variant where the first player is chosen randomly. For this variant, there is a strong disadvantage in being the first player, with an expected value of 2.75 points, as opposed to being the fourth player, with an expected value of 1.37. While both are unbalanced, the published rules provide a more uniform chance of wining for all players.

The designers of Pairs propose a continuous variant, where the round is not over when a player bows out or draws a pair. Instead, only the current player's hand is discarded, and on their next turn they must take a card
from the stock. This variant can be captured in RECYCLE with a single stage and much simpler structure. In simulated games with four players, we found this one-round variant to be well balanced. We also noted another property of the continuous variant; the expected value for each player rose from 9 points to 11.5 points. This variant could therefore have more tension, as all players are closer to the threshold for losing the game.

\ColumnFigure{1}{graphics/PairsGameLength.pdf}{Game length as a function of number of players in Pairs.}{fig:PairsLength}
    
Second, we investigated: \textit{what methods can be used to keep game length constant while varying the number of players?}. Note that the advertised game length for Pairs is 15 minutes. In the rules, the number of points necessary to lose a game of Pairs is scaled to the number of players, according to the formula ``Take 60, divide by players, then add 1." To explore how this simple rule affects the length of the game, we simulated games with only random players for 2 through 5 players. We forgo estimating the clock time for each decision, and instead report in Figure \ref{fig:PairsLength} the average number of calls to a \verb|choice| block for a player decision. We found that there is a very consistent correspondence between the number of players and the length of the game, demonstrating that the scaling is having the desired effect. A different rule could be implemented to provide perfect consistency, however the loss of simplicity would not be worth the complication.

Finally, we asked: \textit{with only two choices per turn, does Pairs retain the potential for strategy?}  We ran simulations for 2 through 5 players, using one PIPMC and leaving the remaining players random. Since the goal in Pairs is to not lose as opposed to win, we report in Figure \ref{fig:PairsMarkovGain} the non-loss percentage for the PIPMC player in comparison to the expected probability of not losing for a random player, given the assumption that the game is fair. We can see the PIPMC is drastically better than the uniform random players, quickly approaching a non-loss probability of 1.
