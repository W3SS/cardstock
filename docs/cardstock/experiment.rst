Running Experiments
===================


    Open "CardStockXam" project.
    Write up your game in RECYCLE.
    Alter the Program.cs class to create an Experiment object for your game.
    Run the program in either Release or Debug mode.
    Choose "Release Mode" to only see the results, or "Debug Mode" to see all game actions (better logs in the future).
