# Abstract Card Game Design and Analysis

Card games have long been enjoyed by children and adults of all ages. However, some card games are more 
popular than others. Our research goal is to computationally simulate various card games and quantify 
their quality automatically. We have thus far developed two components: a card 
game description language. and an interpreter for this language. Using these 
components, we can generate sample run transcripts and analyze their game flow.â€©

First, we created a language, titled RECYCLE, in which turn-based games can be represented. We restrict 
ourselves to games which use only cards and numeric tokens and where all card locations are spatially independent.
Second, we implemented a library, written in C#, called Card Stock, which contains the functions and 
mechanisms necessary to run RECYCLE programs and executes the basic operations performed in these card 
games. The games written in RECYCLE are simulated with random players to collect statistics, such as player 
branching factor, average game length, game complexity, etc.
